<br>I'm a big fan of Beijing Opera, particularly the Cheng School (程派) . The artistry, symbolism, and intricate movements of Beijing Opera have always fascinated me, making it a profound and cherished part of my life. As a beginner, I attended Follow-Me class sponsored by Shanghai Jingju Theatre for twice.

<br>I (and my lover) am fortunate to have two hamsters and one cat who bring so much joy and happiness. Watching them scurry around, play with toys, and stuff their little cheeks with food never fails to bring a smile to my face. My pets have brought an incredible amount of joy and love into my life. Their unconditional affection and playful nature have a way of making everything better.
