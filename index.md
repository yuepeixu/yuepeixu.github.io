## About Me

- Hi, here is **Yuepei Xu** ([许岳培](https://yuepeixu.github.io/file/YuepeiXu_CV.pdf)).

- I am now a PhD student specializing in **Applied Psychology (Behavioral Decision-making)**, at Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([中国科学院心理研究所](http://www.psych.ac.cn/)). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Dr. Zhu-Yuan Liang ([梁竹苑](http://www.psych.cas.cn/team/fyjy/index_90511.html?json=http://www.psych.cas.cn/sourcedb_psych_cas/cn/expert/201704/t20170411_6369873.json)).
- Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep interest in understanding how individuals make decisions and the factors that influence their choices. I am intrigued by the intricate interplay between cognition, emotions, and behavior, and how these components shape the decisions we make in our daily lives.

## Research Interests

- My current research mainly focuses on two parts:
    - **Intertemporal decision-making and future-related cognition:** Individuals possess unique perspectives on their future, and these distinct outlooks can significantly influence their time preference and intertemporal decision-making. My research focuses on unpacking people's future-related cognition, and linking them to people's intertemporal preference.
    - **Nudge within a social context:** Changes in choice architecture could alters people's behavior in a predictable way, without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives ([Nudge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory#cite_note-R._Thaler_and_C._Sunstein._2008-16) ,Richard & Cass Sunstein, 2008). Applying nudge strategy within a social context, various powerful tools, such as social norms, can be utilized as interventions to promote a happier life.
    
    - In addition to my research pursuits, the emergence of the replication crisis has sparked a deep fascination within me for exploring and applying various measurement and statistical methods commonly employed in psychology. While my expertise in this area may be considered foundational, I am dedicated to continuously expanding my knowledge and sharing it with others.
